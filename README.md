# slowLoris
DDoS tool
Breakdown of the code :



1.Importing necessary modules: The script begins by importing the necessary Python modules - socket for network connections, random for generating random numbers, time for handling time-related tasks, and sys for accessing command-line arguments.

2.Defining the Slowloris function: The slowloris function is defined with one parameter, ip, which is the IP address of the target server.

3.User Agents: A list of user agents is defined. These are used to make the requests appear as though they are coming from different browsers.

4.Creating a new socket: A new socket is created using the socket.socket function, and a connection is established with the target server using the sock.connect method.

5.Sending the initial headers: The script sends an initial set of HTTP headers to the server. These include a GET request, a User-Agent header (chosen randomly from the list of user agents), and an Accept-language header.

6.Keeping the connection open: The script enters an infinite loop where it continually sends more headers to the server, with a delay of 10 seconds between each header. This is done to keep the connection open for as long as possible without fully completing the HTTP request.

7.Handling socket errors: If a socket error occurs (for example, if the server closes the connection), the script breaks out of the loop.

8.Main function: If the script is run as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module), it checks if the correct number of command-line arguments has been provided. If not, it prints a usage message and exits. If the correct number of arguments has been provided, it calls the slowloris function with the IP address provided as a command-line argument

#Core Concept: 
The Slowloris attack works by opening many connections to the target web server and keeping them open for as long as possible. It does this by continually sending partial HTTP requests, none of which are ever completed. This gradually consumes the server’s connection resources, eventually leading to denial of service as legitimate requests cannot be handled.
